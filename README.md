# Animal Crossing Classifier

Creating a classifier using animal crossing data from the [Animal Crossing New Horizons Catalog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset)

To download the .csv file you just need to make an account with [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=startRegisterTab&returnUrl=%2F)



In this project I am taking villagers personality, gender and species to try and classify what hobby they have.



I initially used a json but the data was really hard to work with so I found a .csv of the animal crossing data instead. 



The probability is really low, I tried adding more and less things to compare and it didn't seem to improve the score. Also weird that in the last line even though I ask for 12 examples I only get 3.
